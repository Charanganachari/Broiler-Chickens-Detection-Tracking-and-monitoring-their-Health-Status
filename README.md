Business Problem: 
The poultry farm is facing a problem of high mortality rates and decreased productivity, which is negatively affecting their profits and reputation.

This is leading to difficulty in meeting customer demands and adversely impacting the farm's reputation. The farm needs to identify the root causes of the problem and take appropriate action to mitigate it.
